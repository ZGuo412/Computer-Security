# Computer-Security
HW1 based on go over all key space which is 2^16 to find the key and decrypted the encrypted message. The encryption and decryption method is based on XOR. We use the same key for encryption and decryption.


HW2 I implemented DES to encrypt and decrypt the input message and image. All the steps for decrption are same as encryption which is different from AES.

HW3 I developed a program to check the input group is ring or field.

Hw4,5 based on implementing AES. I implemented AES to encrypted and decrypted txt and image file

HW7 based on gengerate the hash hex string for sha256 step by step.

HW8 I developed a program to simulate the TCP attack and understanding the concept of it.
