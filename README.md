# Computer-Security
HW1 based on go over all key space which is 2^16 to find the key and decrypted the encrypted message. The encryption and decryption method is based on XOR. We use the same key for encryption and decryption.


HW2 I implemented DES to encrypt and decrypt the input message and image. All the steps for decrption are same as encryption which is different from AES.

HW3 I developed a program to check the difference between ring and field.
